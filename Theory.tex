\section{\textbf{Theory}}\label{sec:2}
    Performing a circuit analysis~\cite{IRWIN} for the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:schem_pspice} for $R_{b}$ being the base resistance, $V_{s}$ the source voltage and $R_{m}$ the equivalent motor resistance we obtain as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    
\item Considering Q1 and Q2 as short circuits and Q3 and Q4 as open nodes
\begin{equation}
I_{m} = \frac{V_{s}}{R_{m}}
\end{equation}
\item Considering Q3 and Q4 as short circuits and Q1 and Q2 as open nodes
\begin{equation}
I_{m} = -\frac{V_{s}}{R_{m}}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

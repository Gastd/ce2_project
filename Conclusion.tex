\section{\textbf{Conclusion}}\label{sec:6}
This paper demonstrated how the concepts acquired through the course could be brought in real world applications like a simplistic H bridge circuit being able to control the direction of a moving robot.

The built H bridge proved to be an efficient device for controlling the speed of a low power DC motor. It is, in general, a simple circuit with wide usage among robotics applications due to it's versatility. A more elaborate approach might make use of PWM with H bridge for additional control over the motor's velocity.

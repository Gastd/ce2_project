\section{\textbf{Manufacturing}}\label{sec:4}
    For this project two PCB were made, hence in the presentation will be used two motors.
    As the simulation (see Section~\ref{sec:3}) proved that the designed circuit works as intended the physical components were assembled in a breadboard for further testing and validation before the final manufacturing \todo{complete with relevant information about final board}. Figure~\ref{fig:proto_h} shows the circuit properly assembled. This circuit's evaluation will be further discussed in Section~\ref{sec:5}.

    \subsubsection{Fritizing} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:fritizing}
        For aid the design of the printed circuit board it was used the software Fritizing\footnote{\url{http://fritzing.org/home/}}, that is an open source software used worldwide by hobbyists and it is an Electronic Design Automation software
        The Fritizing has 3 environments, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:breadboard}, they are breadboard, schematic and PCB, it was used only the schematic and design environments since the breadboard already has been evaluated.

	As the simulation (see Section~\ref{sec:3}) proved that the designed circuit works as intended the physical components were assembled in a protoboard for further testing and validation before the final manufacturing \todo{complete with relevant information about final board}. Figure\todo{INSERT AND REF PROPOER PROTOBOARD FIGURE} shows the circuit properly assembled. This circuit's evaluation will be further discussed in Section~\ref{sec:5}.

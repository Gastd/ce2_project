\section{\textbf{Evaluation}}\label{sec:5}

	First of all the protoboard circuit \todo{ref protoboard fig} was tested using a multimeter to ensure it's proper functionality. With Q1 and Q2 activated the voltage measured across the motor was $3.8\;V$ \todo{review values}, for future analysis this situation (Q1 and Q2 active) will be called S1. With Q3 and Q4 activated the voltage measured was $-2.9\;V$, this will be the S2 situation. The polarity inversion was accomplished, however the magnitude for both cases which was expected to be equal was in fact different. A slightly tension drop occurred when the current flew backwards \todo{explain why. idk why}. \todo{ADDITIONAL: MEASURE MOTOR SPIN SPEED}
	
	Despite the previous mentioned discrepancy the circuit performed as intentioned therefore the motor was plugged into the circuit. For S1 the motor spun in the \todo{verify if clockwise or counterclockwise}. On the other hand for S2 it spun \todo{the opposite} slightly slower, as a result of the voltage drop previous mentioned.
	
	Finally with the printed circuit board in hands the tension across the output pins were once again measured with a voltmeter. In case S1 the voltage showed up to be \todo{MEASURE THIS!!!}. Though for S2 the tension measured was \todo{measure}. As the PCB performed exactly as the protoboard circuit the motor was connected and the final configuration was achieved. \todo{measure motor speed and direction and insert here}
